                <p id="contentStyle1">No, cookies are not necessarily "bad". Cookies are small strings of data that are stored directly in the browser. They are used to monitor your browsing activity and remember certain information about you — like what’s in your shopping cart, or your login information. Often, they are considered helpful and a necessary part to run many websites. </p>
                <p id="contentStyle1">There are first-party cookies that are placed by the site you visit, and then there are third-party cookies, such as those placed by advertisers to see what you’re interested in and in turn serve you ads — even when you leave the original site you visited<sup>1</sup>.</p>
                <p id="contentStyle1">A few years ago, the GDPR privacy law went into effect in Europe, which led to companies all over the world adding a cookie pop-up to their website, just in case. That's why almost every website has a pop-up asking if you'll accept their use of cookies, which many of us approve without thinking.</p>
               <p id="contentStyle3">If you want to check what cookies the website you are browsing has collected, you can right click to "Inspect", then either go to the Applications tab (Chrome) or Storage (Safari), where you'll be able to see the cookies listed with the data they contain. <br><br> <i> If you check now, you'll see the one where your time of entry was stored.</i></p>
